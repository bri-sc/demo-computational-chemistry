## Computing in Chemistry Demo
This is a Bristol Scientific Computing (BriSC) Python interactive demonstration that showcases how Chemistry can be applied in a computing context. This provides a taster for the type of coding and approach we take on the "Chemistry with Computing" programme at the University of Bristol. See the See the [BriSC webpage](https://brisc.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/) and [Undergraduate Programme for Chemistry with Computing](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/chemistry-computing/) for more details.

The Jupyter notebook uses data sourced from:
