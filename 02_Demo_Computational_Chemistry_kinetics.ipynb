    "In this demo we will have a look at a different set of data for a typical chemical reaction that might take place for a kinetics study, where the progress of the reaction is monitored over time. A common way to do this is look at the loss in mass of the reactant over time (if it is producing a gaseous product) and use the known starting mass to calculate the concentrations. We will then determine the rate order of the reactant (zeroth, first, second), by plotting graphs from integrated rate laws. We will then use _machine learning_ to predict the concentration of one of the reagents at a given time.\n",

This uses the data given to create a line of best fit for the graph, and we can then use this to extrapolate or predict data points outside the current given range, as well as interpolate (predicting data points within the range)."
